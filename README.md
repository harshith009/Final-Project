# Final-Project
I have performed an experimental analysis on the StudentLife dataset to study possible relation between various aspects of the college students life and their respective mental health levels. 
Several attributes have been identified and their correlation with the mean stress levels has been measured. 
Using these attributes as factors we predicted the variability of students mental health. 
The experimental results have been successfully interpreted by the root mean square error value which shows the accuracy of the model. 
The predicted values were compared against the ground truth values, which is our Mean Stress data. 
The folder ‘stress analysis’ is my model and ‘stress analysis 2’ is future work using other classification models. 
All the data I used is from Dartmouth College. 
This consists of passive and automatic sensing data from the phones of a class of 48 Dartmouth students over a 10 week term to assess their mental health (e.g., depression, loneliness, stress), academic performance (grades across all their classes, term GPA and cumulative GPA) and behavioral trends (e.g., how stress, sleep, visits to the gym, etc. change in response to college workload -- i.e., assignments, midterms, finals -- as the term progresses).
